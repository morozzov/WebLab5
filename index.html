                <h3>Painting</h3>
                <p>Painting is one of the oldest kinds of art, dating back tens of thousands of years, and is evident on caves at various sites across the world, such as the Drakensberg in South Africa, the Northern Territory in Australia, and the Lascaux paintings in France to name only three of many sacred sites that are scattered across the globe. Some of these sites have become designated world heritage sites to preserve cultural history associated with those areas, and to preserve them.</p>
                <p class="hightlight">Painting is the application of paint, usually on a two-dimensional surface.</p>
                <p>Paint consists of a pigment, combined with a binding agent such as oil, egg, or water and possibly a filler, to make the quantity more substantial. In ancient times, people relied on natural materials such as plant matter, bones, and soft stones and rocks to make their pigments but today artificial coloring is mostly used. In modern times, various other additives are included in the ingredients, which make the paint more user-friendly and convenient.</p>
                <p>Paint can be applied in various ways – the sky’s the limit. Brushes, fingers, spray cans or sponges can be used, for example. In modern art, painters mostly use canvas to paint on but other surfaces such as board or wood can also be used.</p>
                <p>As techniques and styles have evolved, painting has become an institution in its own right, inspiring study, analysis, and debate. Paintings can usually be classified into one or several of many art movements that are characterized in terms of the underlying philosophy that determined the style, content, and subject matter of the paintings as well as their temporal location in terms of their relationship to previous art movements.</p>
                <p class="hightlight">Well-known art movements that started in Europe include Impressionism (1867-1886), Surrealism (1924-1966), and Expressionism 1905-1920).</p>
                <p>Different cultures all over the world developed different styles as well, such as Pop Art in the USA in the mid-20th century. There is a countless number of painters who could be mentioned as examples of artists, but some of the most famous names include Salvador Dalí (1904-1989) from Spain, Jackson Pollock (1912-1956) from the USA, and Katsushika Hokusai (1760-1849) from Japan.</p>

            <div id="Sculpture" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Sculpture</h3>
                <p>Sculpture is another ancient art form, dating back to some of the earliest civilizations. Unlike painting though, this form of art involves the creation of art in the three dimensions. The type of material used can be anything natural or artificial – from clay, metal, and wood to objects that artists come across in their everyday lives.</p>
                <p class="hightlight">Different processes can be used in creating sculptures, such as modeling, casting, assembling, and carving.</p>
                <p>Sculptures can be free-standing, independent forms, or they can be made in relief, where the form emerges from a background. An example of a free-standing sculpture is Christ the Redeemer (1931) in Rio de Janeiro by Paul Landowski.</p>
                <p>Mount Rushmore which was constructed between 1927 and 1941 is a colossal demonstration of a sculpture done in relief, as well as the elaborate forms carved into the temple complex at Khajuraho in India. Sculptures can also include other forms of art, especially painting.</p>
                <p class="hightlight">Figurines and larger examples of sculptures from the ancient world have been found in various locations around the world. They often had a spiritual or religious connection.</p>
                <p>The ancient Greeks and Romans were also known for their exceptional sculptures, such as The Orator and Head of a Roman Patrician, both of which were created in the 1st century BCE. The Statue of Liberty is a more modern example of sculpture (1886) that has become famous around the world.</p>

            <div id="Architecture" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Architecture</h3>
                <p>People often identify architecture as going back to the very first structures that people built as dwellings. If we are to define architecture in this way, we can think of the teepee in America or the yurt in Mongolia. Some architecture has a distinct aesthetic quality though – indeed, the relationship between utility and beauty is sometimes central in architectural design as it is in other forms of art.</p>
                <p class="hightlight">Looking back, some of the most exquisite examples of architecture still boggle the mind.</p>
                <p>Think of the Pyramids in Egypt which are thousands of years old, the Colosseum (70 A.D.) in ancient Rome, and the magnificent Taj Mahal (1648) in India – each of these marvels has its own story that continues to capture our hearts and remind us of earlier times in our collective history that reflect the beautiful, heart-wrenching and sometimes darker aspects of what it means to be human.</p>
                <p>Some of the extraordinary modern-day architectural marvels include the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy, the Eiffel Tower (1887) in France, and the Sydney Opera House (1973) in Sydney, Australia. Other contemporary buildings that have been dreamt into existence that changed the way we see buildings include the Louvre (1793), the Guggenheim Museum (1959), and the Glass House (1949-1995).</p>

            <div id="Literature" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Literature</h3>
                <p>The word “literature” is derived from the Latin word that is translated as “letters” and refers to the written word in particular. Language is a powerful and symbolic way of communicating, and writing is no exception. The earliest texts date back thousands of years to Mesopotamia, although it is thought that writing developed independently on different continents.</p>
                <p class="hightlight">The first piece of literature with an identifiable author was some of the prayers written by the priestess Ur in Sumeria in Mesopotamia.</p>
                <p>At different times and in different cultures, societies used the unique technology and resources they found in their unique, immediate natural environment to write. For example, hieroglyphics were written on rock and papyrus (handmade paper made from plants that grew in water). In Sumeria, where evidence of the first writer was found, the writing that emerged within this culture was done predominantly with wet clay and to communicate across long distances when cities began flourishing and trade became easier.</p>
                <p class="hightlight">Words are the medium the writer manipulates in creative ways to stimulate an emotional response in readers.</p>
                <p>Literature includes poetry, articles, novels, plays, folklore, myths, and legends as well as other forms of writing. It is most often divided into fiction and non-fiction, but this distinction can sometimes be inappropriate as some stories contain elements of both, especially in folklore and myth.</p>
                <p>The history of literature is teeming with literary giants and their works of art, and it is therefore impossible to pinpoint the most influential or the best without resorting to subjective opinion. Libraries have kept millions of books around the world since ancient times – today there is a growing industry in electronic text, books, and the storage of data.</p>

            <div id="Music" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>Music is created when there is an organization of sounds, as vibrations, that are put together to form an audible composition. Elements of a musical composition include harmony, timbre, melody, and rhythm. Although the presence of music in ancient civilization is harder to trace than visual art, remains of musical instruments have been found that are thousands of years old.</p>
                <p class="hightlight">Music and sound created by the voice and/or instruments have played an important role in various cultures on all continents of the globe making it a universal feature of humanity.</p>
                <p>Like paint, early instruments were made from a variety of natural resources that communities found within their vicinity, while today a vast selection of ready-made instruments are available for musicians to choose from that are classified into three groups: string (such as the violin and guitar), percussion (such as cymbals and the drums) and wind (such as the flute and saxophone).</p>
                <p>While, originally, music was confined to their communities, thanks to modern developments in technology, today music from different places in the world is becoming more and more accessible to people in faraway places. In addition to folk music, there is a huge variety of genres in music that includes funk, blues, hip-hop, pop, rock, electronic, gospel, country, and indie to name a few.</p>

            <div id="Cinema" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Cinema</h3>
                <p>Relative to the other art types discussed in this article, cinema is a fairly recent form of art. Instead of attributing the development of cinema to one inventor, many great minds contributed to the entrance of cinema into people’s lives as is the case with many great inventions and discoveries of our time.</p>
                <p class="hightlight">Cinema first took the form of a “kinetoscope” in 1893, which was a contraption that enabled one person to see the motion picture at a time. The first public show was made in 1895 in Paris.</p>
                <p>Early films were not as we know them today, and nor was the atmosphere in which they were broadcast. Visuals lasted only a few minutes and some of the content included comedy skits, news, and pictures of lands beyond the borders. Unlike cinema today, there was often much participation from the audience.</p>
                <p>At the turn of the century, much was afoot in the industry of cinema, with many new film industries emerging, especially in Europe and Russia. When they were first created they did not have sound but by the 1930s, most movies had sound.</p>
                <p class="hightlight">Since then, the attendance rate has had an exponential increase, with a movement in the last few decades toward an increase in film accessibility in private spaces.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="Theater" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Theater</h3>
                <p>Theater is a performance art that usually includes a visual element that has been used for entertainment purposes for thousands of years. One of the most famous locations central to bringing Romans together for entertainment was the Colosseum which, although now in ruins, remains a testimony to the flourishing culture of the Roman Empire. Indeed, Rome in the 6th century BCE is seen as the earliest example of theater in the “western world”.</p>
                <p>However, long before this oral storytelling, voice, sounds, and gestures were used to transmit important information from one generation to another before written language was invented. Evidence for visual story-telling goes back tens of thousands of years, but it is widely accepted that story-telling through sounds, song, dance, and charts formed an integral medium through which traditions were passed down and retained.</p>
                <p>Theater is a unique form of art in the sense that it can combine several different forms of art in one theater production. A variety of artists can be involved in the range of complex elements that may be involved in a theater production, including costume and stage designers, musicians, actors, and writers.</p>
                <p class="hightlight">Theater can take several forms such as puppetry, dance, circuses, magic shows, or plays.</p>
                <p>The history of theater is rich and alive with the spectrum of human emotion that we have all experienced when witnessing the stories that are embodied in performance, whether in cinema, theater, or even spoken word. Genres include tragedy, comedy, and drama.</p>
                <p>Although cinema has taken the world by storm within its relatively short lifespan, theater remains alive and well. Some famous modern-day theater productions include Lord of the Dance and The Lion King which were started in 1996 and 1997 respectively.</p>

                <h3>Other Art Types</h3>
                <p>In this article, we have explored the seven different types of art that have permeated the boundaries of space and time, infiltrated our conceptions of temporality to embody an enduring creative spirit that is the heartbeat of human life.</p>
                <p>After expanding upon the seven primary forms, it should be said that contemporary art has taken on new faces and forms that should not be excluded from any modern definition of art, with new artistic horizons being conquered in the realms of fashion, digital art, and graphic design and photography as three examples of recent trends in art that do not conform to the types of art discussed in this article but should nevertheless be taken into account.</p>
                <p class="hightlight">Art has been around since the early days of humanity and has changed considerably over the centuries. The thread of creativity, expressed in the form of theatre, music, painting, sculpture, architecture, cinema, and literature, has continued to weave its way across the world and into the cracks of our imagination through the years. Art continues to bring color and life into an ever-changing world in a way that not only stimulates an intellectual response but which also touches our hearts.</p>
